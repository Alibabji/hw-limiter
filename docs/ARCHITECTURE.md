# Hardware Limiter Architecture

## Goals
- Detect host CPU/GPU models using Windows-native APIs.
- Present a Qt GUI with selectable "profile targets" that map to reduced performance levels.
- Apply throttling through built-in Windows power settings (CPU), vendor CLIs (GPU), and optional custom scripts, while enforcing explicit warnings for aggressive caps.

- **Qt App Shell** (`src/MainWindow.cpp`): Windows-targeted Qt Widgets UI. Hosts the hardware snapshot, renders downgrade lists, displays safety prompts, and triggers throttling commands.
- **HardwareInfo** (`src/HardwareInfo.*`): Uses `__cpuid` and DXGI to expose `CpuInfo` / `GpuInfo` structs.
- **ProfileLoader** (`src/ProfileLoader.*`): Reads `resources/profiles.json` (generated by `scripts/generate_profiles.py`) with a lightweight parser (`SimpleJson.hpp`) into strongly-typed `CpuProfile`/`GpuProfile` objects.
- **PowerThrottler** (`src/PowerThrottler.*`): Applies CPU targets via PowerCfg (max processor state, affinity, boost mode) and calls vendor hooks (e.g., `nvidia-smi -lgc`) when available.
- **ProfileEngine** (`src/ProfileEngine.*`): Matches live hardware to compatible downgrade options and exposes them to the UI.

## Data Flow
1. On startup, `HardwareInfo` captures CPU/GPU inventory.
2. `ProfileLoader` parses JSON describing each supported SKU and its allowable downgrade targets (IDs + settings payloads).
3. `ProfileEngine` cross-checks runtime hardware against the dataset, building a list of downgrade choices with estimated perf deltas.
4. User selects a target; `PowerThrottler` executes the associated actions (power plan tweaks, clock caps, optional scripts).
5. UI reflects current state and prompts for elevation if needed.

## Security Considerations
- Throttler runs privileged commands; we wrap them and log failures.
- Profiles can embed shell snippets, so repository defaults restrict to vetted entries.
- Revert path provided via "Restore defaults" button that reapplies original power plan and clears vendor limits.

## Platform Notes
- **Windows**: The only supported platform. `PowerThrottler` shells out to `powercfg` and `nvidia-smi`, so administrator privileges and NVIDIA drivers are required.
- **Other OSes**: Not packaged or supported; building outside Windows is strictly for contributor experimentation.

## Next Steps
- Implement cross-vendor throttling adapters (AMD ADLX / Intel Arc Control) to extend GPU support.
- Persist the last applied tier and add telemetry for successes/failures plus any driver error output.
- Sign or hash profile bundles to protect against tampering before distributing binaries.
